# Lab 1: Observing Algorithm Efficiency

**CPTR 242 — Sequential and Parallel Data Structures and Algorithms**
Walla Walla University

---

## Overview

In this lab you will **run complete programs and observe their behavior**. There is no coding required. Your job is to read the output carefully, record what you see, and reason about what it means.

By the end you should be able to:

- Explain what runtime and memory usage tell you about an algorithm
- Describe the difference between best-case, worst-case, and average-case performance
- Recognize O(1), O(log n), O(n), and O(n²) behavior from empirical data
- Explain why theoretical complexity and real-world measurements sometimes differ


---

## Background: What Are We Measuring?

When we say an algorithm is "efficient," we mean two things:

- **Time complexity** — how does the number of operations grow as input size `n` grows?
- **Space complexity** — how does memory usage grow as `n` grows?

We also care about *when* we measure:

- **Best case** — the luckiest possible input (e.g., searching for an item that's in position 0)
- **Worst case** — the hardest possible input (e.g., searching for an item that isn't there)
- **Average case** — a typical random input

Today you will observe all three using two classic algorithms: **linear search** and **binary search**.

---

## Setup

I suggest running the following commands from your base user directory:

```bash
mkdir cs242 
cd cs242
```

All programs in this lab are self-contained. Each one:
- Generates its own test data
- Runs the algorithm multiple times to average out noise
- Prints results directly to the terminal

Compile and run each program exactly as shown. Record the output in the tables provided.

**Compiler command for all programs:**
```bash
g++ -O0 -o program program.cpp && ./program
```

> The `-O0` flag disables compiler optimizations so you observe the algorithm's true behavior, not the compiler's cleverness.

## Model 1: Counting Operations

Before we look at real time, let's look at something more precise: **operation counts**.

The following program runs linear search and binary search on arrays of increasing size, and **counts exactly how many comparisons each algorithm makes**.

### Program 1 — `operation_counts.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

// Returns the number of comparisons made to find target.
// Returns -1 if not found (count still recorded).
int linearSearch(const vector<int>& v, int target, long long& comparisons) {
    comparisons = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)v.size(); i++) {
        comparisons++;
        if (v[i] == target) return i;
    }
    return -1;
}

int binarySearch(const vector<int>& v, int target, long long& comparisons) {
    comparisons = 0;
    int lo = 0, hi = (int)v.size() - 1;

    while (lo <= hi) {
        int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;

        comparisons++; // == comparison
        if (v[mid] == target) return mid;

        comparisons++; // < comparison
        if (v[mid] < target) lo = mid + 1;
        else hi = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

void printRow(int n, long long linBest, long long linWorst, long long linAvg,
                      long long binBest, long long binWorst, long long binAvg) {
    cout << setw(10) << n
         << setw(12) << linBest  << setw(12) << linWorst << setw(12) << linAvg
         << setw(12) << binBest  << setw(12) << binWorst << setw(12) << binAvg
         << "\n";
}

int main() {
    vector<int> sizes = {10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000};

    cout << "\n--- Operation Counts: Linear Search vs. Binary Search ---\n\n";
    cout << setw(10) << "n"
         << setw(12) << "Lin Best" << setw(12) << "Lin Worst" << setw(12) << "Lin Avg"
         << setw(12) << "Bin Best" << setw(12) << "Bin Worst" << setw(12) << "Bin Avg"
         << "\n";
    cout << string(82, '-') << "\n";

    for (int n : sizes) {
        // Sorted array: [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]
        vector<int> arr(n);
        iota(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);

        long long comparisons;

        // Best case: target is the first element (linear) or exact midpoint (binary)
        linearSearch(arr, 0, comparisons);
        long long linBest = comparisons;

        binarySearch(arr, arr[(n - 1) / 2], comparisons);
        long long binBest = comparisons;

        // Worst case: target is not in the array
        linearSearch(arr, n, comparisons);   // n is one past the end
        long long linWorst = comparisons;

        binarySearch(arr, n, comparisons);
        long long binWorst = comparisons;

        // Average case: search for each element once, take the mean
        long long totalLin = 0, totalBin = 0;
        int sampleStep = max(1, n / 200);    // sample up to 200 values
        int samples = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += sampleStep) {
            linearSearch(arr, arr[i], comparisons);
            totalLin += comparisons;
            binarySearch(arr, arr[i], comparisons);
            totalBin += comparisons;
            samples++;
        }
        long long linAvg = totalLin / samples;
        long long binAvg = totalBin / samples;

        printRow(n, linBest, linWorst, linAvg, binBest, binWorst, binAvg);
    }

    cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Critical Thinking Questions — Model 1

**Q1.** Look at the **Lin Worst** column. Each time `n` grows by 10×, what happens to the number of comparisons? Write a formula relating Lin Worst to `n`.

> Your answer: F(n) = n, my thinking here is that in the worst case, the number of operations is equal to the input-size.

**Q2.** Look at the **Bin Worst** column. Each time `n` grows by 10×, what happens? Is the growth the same as linear search? Describe the pattern in words.

> Your answer: As n increases by one order of magnitude, the worst-case number of operations increases by approximately six. This is a steady but proportionally decreasing growth rate in the number of operations versus the linear search.

**Q3.** The **Bin Best** column should show `1` for all values of `n`. Why? What is the best-case scenario for binary search, and why does the array size not affect it?

> Your answer: The best case for a binary search is that the middle-element is the subject of the search, and so one operation is performed.

**Q4.** Compare **Lin Avg** to **Lin Worst**. What is the approximate ratio between them across all values of `n`? What does this tell you about where a typical search ends up?

> Your answer: The ratio is approximately 1/2, indicating the typical search averages out somewhere toward the middle of the array.

**Q5.** For `n = 100,000`, binary search makes far fewer comparisons than linear search in the worst case. But for `n = 10`, the difference is small. Does this mean binary search is *always* the right choice? What would make you prefer linear search?

> Your answer: Binary search requires that an array be sorted. For a use case that involved, perhaps, searching an incoming series of smaller, unsorted arrays, a linear search would probably be preferable. Class hint --> For larger arrays which may experience a large number of insertions which will make maintaining the sort of the array problematic, resigning to binary search may be preferable.

## Model 2: Measuring Real Time

Operation counts are exact and machine-independent. But programmers also care about **wall-clock time** — how long the user actually waits.

### Program 2 — `runtime_measurement.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <chrono>
#include <numeric>
#include <iomanip>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
using Clock = chrono::high_resolution_clock;
using us    = chrono::duration<double, micro>;

int linearSearch(const vector<int>& v, int target) {
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)v.size(); i++)
        if (v[i] == target) return i;
    return -1;
}

int binarySearch(const vector<int>& v, int target) {
    int lo = 0, hi = (int)v.size() - 1;
    while (lo <= hi) {
        int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
        if      (v[mid] == target) return mid;
        else if (v[mid] <  target) lo = mid + 1;
        else                       hi = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}

// Run fn() REPS times and return average microseconds.
template<typename Fn>
double timeIt(Fn fn, int reps = 500) {
    auto t0 = Clock::now();
    for (int i = 0; i < reps; i++) fn();
    auto t1 = Clock::now();
    return us(t1 - t0).count() / reps;
}

int main() {
    vector<int> sizes = {1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000};

    cout << "\n--- Runtime Measurement (microseconds, worst-case search) ---\n\n";
    cout << setw(12) << "n"
         << setw(18) << "Linear (us)"

         << setw(18) << "Speedup"

    cout << string(66, '-') << "\n";

    for (int n : sizes) {
        vector<int> arr(n);
        iota(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);

        int target = n;   // not in array — worst case for both

        double linTime = timeIt([&]{ linearSearch(arr, target); });
        double binTime = timeIt([&]{ binarySearch(arr, target); });

             << "\n";
    }

    cout << "\n--- Runtime Measurement (microseconds, best-case search) ---\n\n";

    for (int n : sizes) {
        vector<int> arr(n);
        iota(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);

        double linTime = timeIt([&]{ linearSearch(arr, 0); });      // first element
        double binTime = timeIt([&]{ binarySearch(arr, arr[n/2]); }); // midpoint

             << setw(18) << binTime
             << "\n";
    }

    cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Critical Thinking Questions — Model 2

**Q6.** In Table 2a, when `n` grows from 1,000 to 10,000 (10×), approximately how much does linear search time increase? Does this match what you predicted from your answer to Q1?

> Your answer: The search time increased by an order of magnitude, proportionally the same growth as the input n. My answer to Q1 related the worst case number of operations being equal to the input n, which also increased by an order of magnitude.

**Q7.** Look at the **Speedup** column in Table 2a. Does the speedup stay constant, grow, or shrink as `n` increases? Explain why, using the operation counts from Model 1 as evidence.

> Your answer: The speedup values grow as n increases, which is in line with the results of model one. As n increases, the efficiency gains of the binary search algorithm compound, where for smaller values of n, the differences in efficiency become negligeable. 

**Q8.** In Table 2b (best case), what happens to linear search time as `n` grows? What about binary search? Why are these results so different from the worst case?

> Your answer: Yeah this is an interesting result. I can only surmise that the speed of a for loop and a single if condition finding a target at the first element is always faster than the process to perform an arithmetic operation, if condition, update variables, and return the target in the case of the binary search. Obviously it's a tiny difference but interesting.

## Model 3: Memory Usage

Runtime is only half the picture. Algorithms also consume **memory**. This program measures how much heap memory each approach allocates as `n` grows.

### Program 3 — `memory_usage.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
#include <numeric>
using namespace std;

// A simple allocator that tracks total bytes allocated on the heap.
static long long g_allocated = 0;

void* operator new(size_t size) {
    g_allocated += size;
    return malloc(size);
}
void operator delete(void* ptr) noexcept { free(ptr); }
void operator delete(void* ptr, size_t) noexcept { free(ptr); }

long long measure(int n) {
    g_allocated = 0;
    {
        vector<int> arr(n);
        iota(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);
        // Searching doesn't allocate — all work is done in-place.
        // This measures the cost of *storing* the data structure.
    }
    return g_allocated;
}

// Recursive binary search — allocates a stack frame per call.
long long recursiveBinSearch(const vector<int>& v, int target, int lo, int hi) {
    if (lo > hi) return 0;
    int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
    if      (v[mid] == target) return 0;
    else if (v[mid] <  target) return 1 + recursiveBinSearch(v, target, mid+1, hi);
    else                       return 1 + recursiveBinSearch(v, target, lo, mid-1);
}

int main() {
    vector<int> sizes = {1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000};

    cout << "\n--- Memory Usage: Storing the Array ---\n\n";
    cout << setw(10) << "n"
         << setw(20) << "Heap bytes (array)"
         << setw(22) << "Bytes per element"
         << "\n";
    cout << string(52, '-') << "\n";

    for (int n : sizes) {
        long long bytes = measure(n);
        cout << setw(10) << n
             << setw(20) << bytes
             << setw(22) << fixed << setprecision(1) << (double)bytes / n
             << "\n";
    }

    cout << "\n--- Call Stack Depth: Iterative vs. Recursive Binary Search ---\n\n";
    cout << setw(10) << "n"
         << setw(22) << "Iter stack frames"
         << setw(24) << "Recur stack frames (worst)"
         << "\n";
    cout << string(56, '-') << "\n";

    for (int n : sizes) {
        vector<int> arr(n);
        iota(arr.begin(), arr.end(), 0);

        // Iterative: always 1 stack frame (the function itself)
        long long iterFrames = 1;

        // Recursive: depth = number of recursive calls until base case
        long long recurFrames = 1 + recursiveBinSearch(arr, n, 0, n - 1);

        cout << setw(10) << n
             << setw(22) << iterFrames
             << setw(24) << recurFrames
             << "\n";
    }

    cout << "\n";
    return 0;
}
```

### Critical Thinking Questions — Model 3


**Q9.** When `n` doubles, what happens to total heap memory? What complexity class describes the memory usage of storing an array of `n` integers?

> Your answer: As memory grows proportionally to input (n) this is O(n) complexity.

**Q10.** Look at Table 3b. The iterative version always uses 1 stack frame. The recursive version uses more. How does the number of recursive frames grow as `n` grows? Does this match O(log n)?

> Your answer: The number of frames grows by approximately 3 per increase in n by an order of magnitude. This does match the O(log n) pattern seen in earlier models.


**Q11.** Both the iterative and recursive binary search are O(log n) in *time* complexity. But their *space* complexity is different. State the space complexity of each and explain why they differ.

> Your answer: The iterative algorithm uses a fixed number of variables and no additional memory is needed as n grows. So we can model this as S(n) = k. The recursive algorithm must stack frames until it reaches the base-case, so it will also have a constant data term, but also have a term for n and look something like S(n) = log2(n) + k.

## Model 4: Putting It Together — The Full Picture

This final program runs an O(n²) algorithm alongside the O(n) and O(log n) algorithms, so you can see all three growth rates in the same table.

### Critical Thinking Questions — Model 4

**Q12.** In Table 4a, the O(log n) search times are probably so small they appear as `0.000` ms. This doesn't mean the algorithm takes zero time — it means our millisecond timer isn't precise enough. What does this tell you about using wall-clock time for benchmarking very fast algorithms?

> Your answer: It seems to indicate that measurement would have to be done in smaller units like microseconds to provide a measurement output, and also that some operations are so fast they aren't relevantly perceptable in human-scale.

**Q13.** At `n = 8,000`, how much longer does the O(n²) sort take compared to the O(n) scan? Now imagine `n = 1,000,000`. Using the complexity ratios, estimate how much longer the O(n²) algorithm would take relative to O(n) at that scale. Show your reasoning.

> Your answer: 249.656/0.105 approx 2400. 2400 x 100,000/8000 = 2400 x 125 = 300,000. These rough calculations indicate that the 0(n^2) algorithm would be 300,000 times slower than the O(n) at an n of 100,000. To find the approximate time I had to find the geometric sequence n value of 1,000,000 and then apply this to the time value 0.881: 1,000,000 = 2^n*500 --> 2000 = 2^n --> n = log2(2000) --> n = 11. A11 = 0.881*4^11 --> approx 3,695,181 milliseconds (!). Luckily I just completed precalc II so sequences are fresh or I might have been cooked for this one. There's likely a more efficient way to get at these values, but this is what came to mind with the tools I have presently.

**Q14.** The O(n) scan uses `volatile` on the accumulator variable. Remove the `volatile` keyword, recompile with `-O2` instead of `-O0`, and run again. What happens to the O(n) scan time? Why? What does this reveal about the relationship between benchmarking and compiler optimizations?

> Your answer: The scan time drops to zero with these changes. Allowing compiler optimizations will give an unduly efficient result when benchmarking an algorithm that obscure its actual performance.

**Q15.** Suppose you are building an app that needs to sort a list of items every time a user opens it. The list is currently 1,000 items and your O(n²) sort takes 1 ms — fast enough. Your product grows and the list becomes 100,000 items. Using your observed scaling ratio, estimate the new sort time. Is it still acceptable? What would you do?

> Your answer: The sort time would be approximately 16384 milliseconds using geometric sequence 1*4^7, 7 taken from the number of doublings from 1000 to 100,000. An O(n logn) sorting algorithm would have to be used in place of O(n^2), or perhaps the app could cache the list and only sort when a change is made.

**Key takeaways:**

- Operation counts are the purest measure of complexity — they are machine-independent.
- Wall-clock time is useful but noisy. Compiler optimizations, caching, and hardware all affect it.
- Best and worst case can differ dramatically. Always ask: what input triggers the worst case?
- Space complexity is a second dimension of cost. A faster algorithm is not always worth it if it requires significantly more memory.
- O(n²) algorithms that feel fast on small inputs become unacceptably slow at scale.
