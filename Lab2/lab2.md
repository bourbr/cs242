# Lab 2: Observing Sorting Algorithms

**CPTR 242 — Sequential and Parallel Data Structures and Algorithms**
Walla Walla University

---

## Overview

In this lab you will **run complete programs and observe their behavior**. There is no coding required. Your job is to read the output carefully, record what you see, and reason about what it means.

By the end you should be able to:

- Identify O(n²) and O(n log n) behavior from empirical comparison counts and timing data
- Explain why the same algorithm performs differently on different input arrangements
- Describe the key tradeoffs between sorting algorithms: time, space, stability, and adaptivity
- Read recursive sorting code and trace how it divides and conquers

## Background: What Makes Sorting Hard?

Sorting seems simple — but different algorithms solve it in dramatically different ways, with very different costs. Today you will observe four sorting algorithms side by side:

- **Selection sort** — always scans the full unsorted portion to find the minimum
- **Insertion sort** — builds a sorted prefix by inserting one element at a time
- **Merge sort** — recursively splits in half and merges sorted halves back together
- **Quicksort** — recursively partitions around a pivot element

The central question of this lab: **do the algorithms behave the way theory predicts — and does input shape matter?**

---

## Setup

All programs are self-contained. Each generates its own test data, instruments the algorithm, and prints results directly to the terminal.

**Compiler command for all programs:**
```bash
g++ -O0 -o program program.cpp && ./program
```

> `-O0` disables compiler optimizations so you observe the algorithm's actual behavior.

## Model 1: Counting Comparisons

Operation counts are the purest measure of algorithmic complexity — they are exact and machine-independent. This program runs all four sorting algorithms on arrays of increasing size and counts every comparison made.

### Program 1 — `sort_comparisons.cpp`

        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            comparisons++;
            if (v[j] < v[minIdx]) minIdx = j;
        }
        swap(v[i], v[minIdx]);
    }
}

void insertionSort(vector<int> v) {
    int n = v.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {

            comparisons++;
            if (v[j] > key) { v[j + 1] = v[j]; j--; }
            else break;
        }

### Critical Thinking Questions — Model 1

**Q1.** Compare **Merge** and **Quick** to the **n·log₂(n)** column. Are they above or below it? By roughly what factor? What does this tell you about the constant hidden inside O(n log n)?

> Your answer: Mergesort is slightly below while Quicksort is slightly above, by about the same margin as N increases. There is a 15-20 percent margin below and above the n log n results. So, the constant may be 0.8 for mergesort and 1.2 for quicksort, which could account for slight differences in operations despite having the same overall time complexity.

**Q2.** When n doubles from 1,000 to 2,000, what happens to the Selection sort comparison count? What happens to the Merge sort count? Do these ratios match what you would predict from O(n²) and O(n log n)?

> Your answer: Running the N values through these respective formulas produces approximately the operation counts we see in the output table, but not necessarily the simplification provided by big O notation. In the case of selection sort, simply running n = 2000 into N^2 will give the wrong result, you have to use the actual formula n(n-1)/2. Another (and probably better) way to arrive at the correct count would be to scale N^2 by 2 and divide by N^2, and then scale the original count by that result. This can be done with any of the big O notation formulas.

**Q3.** The Insertion sort comparison count on random data should be roughly between n and n(n-1)/2. Where does it actually land? What does this suggest about its average-case behavior?

> Your answer: Insertion sort is roughly 20 times, or two orders of magnitude, less efficient than O(n) time complexity, and double the efficiency of n(n-1)/2 complexity. Trying to express this as a formula, we can say that the average case for insertion sort looks somehing like 0.25(n^2), or one quarter of O(n^2) and half of n(n-1)/2.

**Q4.** Quick sort's comparison count on random data is likely close to — or sometimes less than — merge sort's. Both are O(n log n). Given that quicksort has an O(n²) worst case, why might it make *fewer* comparisons than merge sort on average?

> Your answer: Although both are O(n log n), quicksort can sometimes use fewer comparisons because its partitioning step can place elements into their final positions early, reducing the need for future comparisons. Mergesort is more stable, and though it doesn't suffer from poor pivot choice, it also can't benefit from a good pivot choice or data quality which can aid in the efficiency of quicksort.

## Model 2: Input Shape Changes Everything

Theoretical complexity describes average behavior. But real inputs are rarely random. This program runs all four algorithms on three different input arrangements: random, already sorted, and reverse sorted.

### Program 2 — `sort_input_shapes.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
#include <random>
using namespace std;

long long comparisons;

// (same sort implementations as Program 1 — paste them here)
void selectionSort(vector<int> v) {
    int n = v.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
        int minIdx = i;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) { comparisons++; if (v[j] < v[minIdx]) minIdx = j; }
        swap(v[i], v[minIdx]);
    }
}

void insertionSort(vector<int> v) {
    int n = v.size();
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        int key = v[i], j = i - 1;
        while (j >= 0) { comparisons++; if (v[j] > key) { v[j+1] = v[j]; j--; } else break; }
        v[j + 1] = key;
    }
}

void merge(vector<int>& v, int lo, int mid, int hi) {
    vector<int> tmp; int i = lo, j = mid + 1;

    comparisons = 0; { vector<int> t = data; quickSort(t, 0, (int)t.size()-1); } r.qs = comparisons;
    return r;

    iota(rand_data.begin(), rand_data.end(), 0);
    shuffle(rand_data.begin(), rand_data.end(), rng);

### Critical Thinking Questions — Model 2

**Q5.** Look at the **Selection** column across all three input types. Does the comparison count change? Why or why not? What does this tell you about selection sort's relationship to input shape?

> Your answer: Comparison counts are close enough, no dominant algorithm. Selection sort performs the same number of operations no matter the input curve.

**Q6.** Look at the **Insertion** column. Already-sorted input should give a dramatically lower count than random or reverse-sorted. By approximately what factor does it drop? What is happening inside the algorithm that explains this?

> Your answer: It drops by a factor of 25 compared to a random input curve and could by modelled by O(n). This happens because only the outer loop is checking if the value preceding the loop variable is larger, and then progressing, the inner while loop is not being engaged. So we end up with a big O value that looks like the time complexity of a for-loop running through a list of size n.

**Q7.** Look at the **Merge** column. Does it change meaningfully across input types? What property of merge sort explains this consistency?

> Your answer: Mergesort splits the arrays by index only, where quicksort might employ an index operation to select a pivot, but the pivot value is what determines how the elements are distributed across the resulting partitions. On sorted data, if the algorithm is coded to pick the first or last index for the pivot, the time complexity will rise to O(n^2) which appears to be happening with the sorted and reverse sorted input curves. Mergesort doesn't experience this phenomenon, splitting without any value-comparison as a factor of the splitting operation.

**Q8.** Look at the **Quick** column on already-sorted input. It is likely much higher than on random input. Explain why — trace what happens when the last element is chosen as pivot and the array is already sorted.

> Your answer: Well I accidentally answered this question above. And it seems my suspicion was correct. The zybooks code for quicksort employed a midpoint formula with floor division for an even array that selected the pivot around the middle of the array, but if the code simply instructed the pivot to be chosen at the beginning or end, this would have negative consequences when a sorted input curve is fed to the algorithm.

**Q9.** Based on this table, which algorithm would you choose for a dataset you *know* is almost always already sorted (e.g., a log file that is mostly in time order with a few late arrivals)? Which would you avoid? Justify your choices.

> Your answer: Insertion sort would have the best time complexity for this use-case. Quicksort would be the least useful here unless a better pivot-selection algorithm was written, in which case it would only be 10 times slower than insertion sort.

## Model 3: Time, Space, and Stability

Comparison counts tell us about the algorithm's logic. But programmers also care about wall-clock time and how much memory an algorithm uses — and whether it preserves the original order of equal elements (stability). This program measures all three.

### Critical Thinking Questions — Model 3

**Q10.** Look at the **Sel mem** and **Ins mem** and **Quick mem** columns. They should be near zero (just the overhead of passing the vector by value). The **Merge mem** column should show values proportional to n. Approximately how many bytes does merge sort allocate per element? Does this match the O(n) space complexity?

> Your answer: It seems to be about 150-200 bytes per element, growing at a linear rate, and so matches the space complexity for mergesort of O(n) versus the O(1) of the other sorting algorithms.

**Q11.** When n grows from 1,000 to 10,000 (10×), how does selection sort's runtime change? How does merge sort's runtime change? Do these match the predicted scaling from O(n²) and O(n log n)?

> Your answer: The value from selection sort is slighly less but close to what we would estimate using big O time complexity modelling: (10n)^2/n^2 = 100. 100 * 3.00 = 300. This is higher than the table's 230.13, but in the ballpark.

**Q12.** At n = 10,000, which algorithm is fastest on random data? Which is slowest? Is the fastest algorithm the one with the best Big-O, or are there other factors at play?

> Your answer: Quicksort and mergesort have the same big O in average cases, but mergesort has more operational overhead in allocating extra memory and copying values during merging, where quicksort operates in place; this means the constant values in the actual time complexity formula should be higher for mergesort and accounts for the higher time output despite generally the same big O expression.

**Q13.** You are building a leaderboard that sorts players by score. When two players have the same score, they should remain in the order they originally achieved it (i.e., first-to-reach-score is ranked higher). Based on the stability results, which sorting algorithms are safe to use? Which are not?

> Your answer: The stability test results indicate that selection, insertion and mergesort are safe to employ for this use-case, where quicksort is not. This is mainly to do with the action of the pivot, where the pivot-value can arbitrarily end up in the left or right partition, and equal values can be 'moved past' each other when being ordered according to the pivot-value. The other algorithms order equal values from left to right (merge) or they only swap values that are greater (not equal to, i.e. selection, insertion) and so preserve original left to right order of equal values.

**Q14.** Merge sort uses O(n) extra memory. On a machine with 8 GB of RAM, sorting a dataset of 1 billion integers (each 4 bytes = 4 GB of data), merge sort would need approximately how much *additional* memory? Is this a concern?

> Your answer: Well, if the array will use half the available RAM just to store initial values, the remaining half will be occupied with the temporary array for the merging portion of the operation. This would mean no random access memory would be available for any other processes which would necessitate the use of stable memory which would cause major slowdown.

## Model 4: Recursion Unrolled

Merge sort and quicksort are recursive. This program makes the recursion visible by printing each call as it happens, so you can see the divide-and-conquer structure directly.

### Program 4 — `sort_recursion_trace.cpp`

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <iomanip>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
#include <random>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

// --- Traced Merge Sort ---
int mergeDepth = 0;

void tracedMerge(vector<int>& v, int lo, int mid, int hi) {
    string indent(mergeDepth * 2, ' ');
    vector<int> tmp; int i = lo, j = mid+1;
    while (i <= mid && j <= hi)
        tmp.push_back(v[i] <= v[j] ? v[i++] : v[j++]);
    while (i <= mid) tmp.push_back(v[i++]);
    while (j <= hi)  tmp.push_back(v[j++]);
    for (int k = 0; k < (int)tmp.size(); k++) v[lo+k] = tmp[k];
    cout << indent << "merge [" << lo << ".." << hi << "] → ";
    for (int k = lo; k <= hi; k++) cout << v[k] << " ";
    cout << "\n";
}

void tracedMergeSort(vector<int>& v, int lo, int hi) {
    string indent(mergeDepth * 2, ' ');
    if (lo >= hi) {
        cout << indent << "base [" << lo << "] = " << v[lo] << "\n";
        return;
    }
    cout << indent << "split [" << lo << ".." << hi << "]\n";
    int mid = lo + (hi-lo)/2;
    mergeDepth++;
    tracedMergeSort(v, lo, mid);
    tracedMergeSort(v, mid+1, hi);
    mergeDepth--;
    tracedMerge(v, lo, mid, hi);
}

// --- Traced Quicksort ---
int quickDepth = 0;

int tracedPartition(vector<int>& v, int lo, int hi) {
    string indent(quickDepth * 2, ' ');
    int pivot = v[hi], i = lo-1;
    cout << indent << "partition [" << lo << ".." << hi << "] pivot=" << pivot << "\n";
    for (int j = lo; j < hi; j++)
        if (v[j] <= pivot) swap(v[++i], v[j]);
    swap(v[i+1], v[hi]);
    int p = i+1;
    cout << indent << "  → pivot " << pivot << " placed at index " << p << " | left: [";
    for (int k = lo; k < p; k++) cout << v[k] << (k<p-1?",":"");
    cout << "] right: [";
    for (int k = p+1; k <= hi; k++) cout << v[k] << (k<hi?",":"");
    cout << "]\n";
    return p;
}

void tracedQuickSort(vector<int>& v, int lo, int hi) {
    if (lo < hi) {
        quickDepth++;
        int p = tracedPartition(v, lo, hi);
        tracedQuickSort(v, lo, p-1);
        tracedQuickSort(v, p+1, hi);
        quickDepth--;
    }
}

int main() {
    vector<int> data = {38, 27, 43, 3, 9, 82, 10};

    cout << "\n=== Merge Sort Trace (n=7) ===\n\n";
    { vector<int> v = data; tracedMergeSort(v, 0, (int)v.size()-1); }

    cout << "\n=== Quicksort Trace (n=7) ===\n\n";
    { quickDepth = 0; vector<int> v = data; tracedQuickSort(v, 0, (int)v.size()-1); }

    // Now show what happens to quicksort on sorted input
    cout << "\n=== Quicksort Trace on SORTED input (n=7, worst case) ===\n\n";
    { quickDepth = 0; vector<int> v = {3, 9, 10, 27, 38, 43, 82}; tracedQuickSort(v, 0, (int)v.size()-1); }

    cout << "\n";
}
```


### Observation: Merge Sort Trace

Run the program and study the merge sort trace output. Answer the questions below based on what you see printed.

**Q15.** How many levels of indentation does the merge sort trace show for n = 7? What does each level of indentation correspond to in terms of the recursion? How does the number of levels relate to log₂(7)?

> Your answer: Log base 2 of 8 (log2(8)) is 3 which matches the indentation level of mergesort with an input curve of n=7.

**Q16.** At the deepest level of indentation, each `base` line shows a single element. After the two `base` lines for the same parent, a `merge` line appears. What is always true about the output of a `merge` step — regardless of what the input subarrays looked like?

> Your answer: The output of a merge step seems to always be a sorted sub-array.

**Q17.** Count the total number of `merge` operations printed. For n = 7, there should be 6. For n elements in general, how many merge operations does merge sort perform? Express this as a function of n.

> Your answer: The number of merge operations to recombine the single element sub-arrays of any n will be n-1.

### Observation: Quicksort Trace — Random vs. Sorted Input

**Q18.** In the random-input quicksort trace, look at the partition steps. Does the pivot tend to split the array into roughly equal halves, or very unequal ones? Now look at the sorted-input trace. What do you observe about the split sizes? How many total partition steps appear in each trace?

> Your answer: The random input split into partitions of 4 elements and 2 elements respectively, and this led to 4 partition steps. For the sorted trace, all of the elements were smaller than the pivot, so there were 6 partition steps, or O(n^2) time complexity owing to a worst-case pivot selection.

**Q19.** In the sorted-input quicksort trace, each partition step's "left" side is empty `[]` and the "right" side has all remaining elements. If this happens at every level on an array of n = 1,000 elements, how many total partition steps would there be? What complexity class is this? 

> Your answer: I partly answered this above incidentally, there would be something like selection sort efficiency with a formula like n(n-1)/2, in the O(n^2) class of time complexity. As far as the number of partition steps, this can be determined with n-1, or 999 steps.

## Extra Credit Questions

**A1.** Radix sort was not in today's programs — it sorts without making element-to-element comparisons at all. Given that all four algorithms we studied today are comparison-based, what fundamental limit do they all share? (Hint: think about what O(n log n) represents for comparison-based sorting.) 

> Your answer: The algorithms seen in this lab have an efficiency bound of O(nlog n) because they are getting a true/false response with every query. This is how they build information about the array. Radix uses buckets, numerical and positional values to emplace elements in the correct order, from least significant to most significant digit. Radix first looks at the ones place and places matches in buckets ordered from least to greatest, then moves on to higher positions creating the same ordered buckets from the order of the previous position. For {172, 2, 17, 150} the first pass would produce [150] [172,2] [17] (ones). Second pass [2] [17] [150] [172] (tens). Final pass [2, 17] [150, 172] (hundreds). This allows radix in some cases to achieve linear time complexity O(n).

## Summary

| Algorithm | Comparisons (random) | Best case | Worst case | Space | Stable | Adaptive |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Selection sort | n(n-1)/2 exactly | O(n²) | O(n²) | O(1) | No | No |
| Insertion sort | ~n²/4 | O(n) | O(n²) | O(1) | Yes | Yes |
| Merge sort | ~n·log₂n | O(n log n) | O(n log n) | O(n) | Yes | No |
| Quicksort | ~1.39·n·log₂n | O(n log n) | O(n²) | O(log n) | No | No |

**Key takeaways:**

- Selection sort makes the same number of comparisons regardless of input — completely non-adaptive.
- Insertion sort is uniquely fast on nearly-sorted data — O(n) best case. This is a real, exploitable property.
- Merge sort is the reliability choice: O(n log n) always, stable, but costs O(n) extra memory.
- Quicksort is fast in practice but fragile on sorted input with a naive pivot strategy.
- Input shape matters as much as algorithm choice. Knowing your data is as important as knowing your algorithm.
- Stability matters when equal elements carry secondary information that must be preserved.
